# GPUOpen Game Engine Integrations

We will be providing example integrations of various GPUOpen technologies into game engines. These example integrations can help jumpstart your own integration of these features into your game or VR title.

### Unreal Engine
We have created a fork of Unreal&reg; Engine to provide example UE4 integrations for some of the libraries and SDKs available on GPUOpen.

* [GPUOpen fork of Unreal Engine](https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine)

#### Example UE4 integrations
* [LiquidVR MGPU](https://github.com/GPUOpenSoftware/UnrealEngine/tree/LiquidVR-MGPU)

#### Instructions
* To access the fork and its various branches, you will first need access to [Epic's Unreal Engine repo](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine).
  * See [Epic's signup information](https://github.com/EpicGames/Signup) on GitHub for instructions.
* You will also need to be signed in to GitHub with the username you entered into your Epic Games account profile.
* Otherwise, the links above to the GPUOpen fork, example integrations, and Epic's repo will not work.
